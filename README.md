Trello Clone
============

To practice my BackboneJS skills, I decided to clone [Trello](http://trello.com),
an organization app in the browser. Users can add boards. These boards contain lists,
which contain cards. These cards contain checklists, and the checklists contain
checklist items.

Users can drag and drop any of these elements to reorder them. This was done using
[JQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com). Whenever the user drags and drops an element, an
AJAX request is sent to the server to update the current ordering of the elements.

Todo: Enable board sharing with other users
